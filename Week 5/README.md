This week we will keep practicing using iterative statements.

We will also talk about the pigeonhole principle, which states that if there are more pigeons than pigeonholes, then there must be at least one pigeonhole with at least two pigeons in it. Of course, this principle applies to other objects besides pigeons and pigeonholes.
The pigeonhole principle is an important proof technique that is used in many surprising domains.

In addition, we will work on our Mathematical skills, and introduce the function notion.

Make sure that by the end of this week you:

- Are familiar with the syntax of the basic iterative statements in C++ (while, for)
- Are able to write programs that use iterative control.
- Understand the definition of a (mathematical) function.
- Are familiar with the terms: domain, target, range
- Know what is a one-to-one function, what is an onto function, and what is a bijection. Be able to determine whether a function has one or more of the above properties.
- Understand how to compute a composition of functions
- Able to find the Inverse function of a given function, or determine that there is no such
