This week we will continue using pointers, dynamic arrays, and the Vector data structure.  

Make sure that by the end of this week you:
- Are able to use pointers to reference objects on the stack
- Are able to use pointers to reference objects on the heap
- Are able to allocate and deallocate memory on the heap
- Understand how to use pointers to access arrays
- Understand how pointer arithmetic works.
- Understand the potential pitfalls of using heap memory
- Use vectors to solve a problem with a dynamic size
