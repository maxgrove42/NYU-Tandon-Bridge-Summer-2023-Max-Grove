# Max Grove's NYU Tandon Bridge Program Repository (Summer 2023)

Welcome to my course repository for the NYU Tandon School of Engineering's Bridge Program, completed in the summer of 2023. This intensive program is designed to equip students without a technical background with the foundational skills necessary for success in STEM graduate programs. This repository contains coursework, projects, exams, and a comprehensive study guide.

## Final Grade: A / Certificate with Distinction
- **Exam 1 Grade:** 99 / 110
- **Exam 2 Grade:** 92 / 100
- **Exam 3 Grade:** 97 / 100
- **Exam 4 Grade:** not released by instructors
- **Homework Grade:** 99 / 100

## Program Description

The NYU Tandon Bridge program is designed as an accelerated pathway for individuals looking to enter the field of computer science and engineering but lack the formal education or background. It covers a comprehensive curriculum ranging from discrete math to operating systems principles, all within a single semester. This repository not only showcases my work but also serves as a resource for future students and applicants to the NYU Tandon's graduate programs.

## Program Objectives

By the end of the program, I achieved:

- A basic understanding of data representation and computational problem-solving.
- Proficiency in developing algorithms and implementing moderate-sized programs in C++.
- A solid foundation in object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithm analysis.
- Insight into operating systems, including processes, threads, and memory management.
- An understanding of discrete mathematics and its applications in computer science.

## Course Topics Covered

This repository includes materials, notes, and projects on the following topics:

- Application, Network, and Transport Layer protocols
- Data Structures: Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Stacks, and Queues
- Programming Concepts: Functions, Recursion, OOP, Memory Management
- Discrete Mathematics: Logic, Proofs, Induction, Counting, Sets, Probability
- Algorithms: Analysis, Searching, Sorting, Complexity
- Systems Programming: Processes & Threads, Thread Concurrency, Deadlocks
- and many more. [[Link to detailed topics](https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/programs/nyu-tandon-bridge/preparatory-resources#chapter-id-51872)]
