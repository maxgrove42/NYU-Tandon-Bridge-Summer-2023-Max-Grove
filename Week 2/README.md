This week we are going to write our first C++ program, and talk about talk about mathematical functions.

We are going to start getting into the details of C++, and talk about data types and expressions.
We will go over int, float, double, string, char and bool. We will talk about their inner representation, C++ literals of these types and several kinds of expressions that can be formed using them. 

A unique kind of such expressions are Boolean expressions that we will use to control the flow of our program and create executions that are more than just sequential.

In addition, we will work on our Mathematical skills, and introduce fundamental proving techniques.

Make sure that by the end of this week you:

Understand the need of compiling a program in a high level language to an equivalent program in machine language
Have a developing environment installed on your computer
Are familiar with the basic structure of a C++ program, and know how to write a simple program of your own
Understand how to use cout and cin instructions
Are familiar with the int data type: know its inner representation, int literals and arithmetic operators that apply on ints
Are familiar with the float and double data types: know their inner representation, C++ literals of these types and arithmetic operators that apply on them.
Understand that the same numeric value is represented differently in different data types.
Are familiar with the syntax for casting, that is used to convert a data from one representation to its equivalent in another representation method.
Understand how the compiler deals with expressions whose operands are of mixed types.
Are familiar with the char and string data types: know their inner representation (using the ASCII table), C++ literals of these types and arithmetic operators that apply on them.
Are familiar with the bool data type: know its inner representation, C++ literals of this type and Boolean operators that apply on it.
Are familiar with relational operators (<, >, <=, >=, ==, !=) and Boolean operators (!, &&, ||) as building blocks of Boolean expression.
Understand how Boolean expressions are used to control the flow of programs in a different order than the default sequential flow.
Are Familiar with rules of inference, both in propositional logic and in predicate logic
Are able to formulate a direct proof for universal and existential statements
Are able to prove by contradiction
Are able to prove by using a contrapositive argument
Are able to use the proof by cases technique
