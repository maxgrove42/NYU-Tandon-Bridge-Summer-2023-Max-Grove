This week we will see some more statements that are used to control the flow of our programs. We will go over while and for loops. These statements allow us to repeat a set of statements over and over.

By using iterative statements, we will be able to express computations that are much more complex. Mastering in using iterative processes takes time, and requires a lot of practice. Make sure you save enough time for practice.

Make sure that by the end of this week you:

Are familiar with the syntax of the basic iterative statements in C++ (while, for)
Are able to write programs that use iterative control.
Practiced a lot
