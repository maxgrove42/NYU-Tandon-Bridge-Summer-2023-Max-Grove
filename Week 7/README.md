This week we will continue to talk about functions, and start talking about combinatorics. We will introduce basic counting techniques. We will see the sum rule and the product rule which are the basic rules in combinatorics. We will also introduce permutations and combinations.

Make sure that by the end of this week you:

Are able to make a call to a function
Are able to define your own function
Understand the flow of the control of your program when functions are involved.
Are familiar with the scoping rules when functions are involved
Are familiar with the run-time-stack model
Understand the difference between call-by-value and call-by-reference.
Are able to design and implement programs using procedural abstraction principles 
Are familiar with the product rule, the sum rule and the bijection rule
Understand what permutations and R-permutations are counting.
Are familiar with the values of permutations and r-permutations 
Understand what R-combinations is counting.
Are familiar with the value of R-combinations
