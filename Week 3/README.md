This week we will start introducing new statements that allow us to control the flow of our programs. Till now all our programs executed the instructions in a sequential order, line after line. There are more sophisticated ways to have our executions flow. We start by introducing branching statements. These statements allow us to choose which block of instructions will be executed, based on the values of Boolean expressions.

Finally, we will talk about sets, a discrete collection on which many other discrete structures are built. We will also introduce some basic properties of sets, and operations related to sets. We will see how to use these operations to compose more complex structures.

Make sure that by the end of this week you:

- Understand how Boolean expressions are used to control the flow of programs in a different order than the default sequential flow.
- Are familiar with the syntax of the basic branching statements in C++ (if, if-else, switch).
- Are able to write programs that use data of all types covered, and use branching control.
- Are familiar with the basic setsâ€™ operations
- Can prove properties related to sets
